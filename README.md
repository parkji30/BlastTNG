# BlastTNG-Tools
BLAST-TNG is a new telescope designed to observe the polarized thermal emission from interstellar dust. The data it collects will provide new insight into the properties of dust and the role of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium through a wide range of densities. BLAST-TNG will produce several-degree-scale polarimetric maps at sub-arcminute resolution, making simultaneous measurements in its 3 broad bands centered at 250, 350, and 500 Î¼m.

The current notebooks in this repository is a list of my work for BlastTNG. My role in this research team was to work on the software development and analysis data that was recorded during flight.

My most notable work was developing a compression algorithm for a real-time data streams and developing an optimal filtering program.
